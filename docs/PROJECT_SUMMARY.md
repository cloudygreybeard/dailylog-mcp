# DailyLog MCP - Project Summary

## Project Overview

MCP server and CLI tool for daily activity logging, built with Go, featuring GitHub storage backend and build automation.

## Completed Features

### Core Architecture
- Go MCP SDK-based server with stdio transport
- GitHub storage provider for private repository storage
- Structured JSON data format for daily activity records
- CLI tool (dailyctl) with command interface
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### MCP Tools (5 Total)
1. **`dailylog_entry`** - Create new daily log entries (activities, status updates, notes, summaries)
2. **`dailylog_get_entries`** - Retrieve entries for specific dates or ranges
3. **`dailylog_search`** - Search through logs by text, tags, status, or criteria
4. **`dailylog_summarize`** - Generate summaries for daily, weekly, monthly periods
5. **`dailylog_ai_assist`** - AI assistance for wording, tags, status analysis, insights

### Data Model
- Entry types: activities, status updates, notes, summaries
- Metadata support: tags, priority, duration, location, custom fields
- Status tracking: 1-10 scale with averages
- Timestamps: Full timestamp tracking with timezone support
- Hierarchical storage: Organized by year/month in GitHub

### CLI Interface
- Log commands: `dailyctl log activity/status/note/summary`
- Retrieval commands: `dailyctl get today/yesterday/week/month/date`
- Search commands: `dailyctl search` with filtering
- Summary commands: `dailyctl summarize day/week/month/custom`
- Multiple output formats: table, JSON, YAML

### Development & Automation
- Makefile with development commands
- GoReleaser configuration for multi-platform releases
- GitHub Actions workflows (CI, release, nightly builds)
- Version management with git tag synchronization

### Documentation & Configuration
- README with examples and usage
- Installation guide with multiple installation methods
- MCP configuration examples for Cursor and VS Code
- API documentation with JSON schema definitions

## Technical Decisions

### Storage Design
- GitHub-based storage for reliability and version control
- JSON file format for human readability and Git-friendly diffs
- Date-based directory structure (YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.json)
- Atomic operations for data consistency

### MCP Integration
- Official Go SDK for MCP protocol compliance
- Stdio transport for AI assistant integration
- Environment variable configuration for security
- JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance with proper error handling

### CLI Design
- Cobra framework for command structure
- Viper configuration for config management
- Multiple output formats for different use cases
- Human-friendly defaults with power-user options

## Usage Examples

### MCP Integration (Cursor/VS Code)
```bash
# Log an activity
@dailylog dailylog_entry {
  "type": "activity",
  "title": "Team meeting",
  "tags": ["work", "meeting"],
  "status": 8,
  "duration": 60
}

# Get today's summary
@dailylog dailylog_summarize {"type": "day"}
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Log entries
dailyctl log activity "Morning workout" --tags health,exercise --status 9

# Get entries
dailyctl get today --stats

# Search logs
dailyctl search --query "exercise" --status-min 7

# Generate summaries
dailyctl summarize week
```

## Security & Privacy

- Private GitHub repository storage
- Personal Access Token authentication
- Environment variable configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- Local-first operation with GitHub sync
- No data sent to third parties (except GitHub)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

### AI Integration
- Real AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) for summaries
- Smart tag suggestions based on content analysis
- Status pattern analysis and insights
- Natural language processing for search

### Advanced Features
- Web dashboard for visualization
- Mobile companion app
- Team collaboration features
- Data analytics and reporting
- Calendar integration

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup and build
make setup          # Initialize development environment
make build          # Build all components
make install        # Install binaries locally

# Development cycle
make dev.iterate    # Build and install
make test           # Run tests
make clean          # Clean artifacts

# Release
make release        # Create release with GoReleaser
make info.status    # Show project status
```

## Project Statistics

- **12 Go source files** implementing the complete system
- **22 total project files** including documentation, configs, and workflows
- **5 MCP tools** for daily logging functionality
- **Multiple CLI commands** with subcommands and options

## Conclusion

The DailyLog MCP project delivers a daily activity logging solution with:

1. **Functional architecture** using standard patterns
2. **Complete tooling** for both AI assistants and human users
3. **Secure storage** in private GitHub repositories
4. **Build automation** and quality controls
5. **Extensible design** for future enhancements

The project provides value for users wanting to track daily activities through AI assistants (Cursor, VS Code) while maintaining full control over their data through private GitHub storage.
